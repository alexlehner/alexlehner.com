I've heard a few people say to avoid using `git rebase`. That's crazy talk! Like many commands, it has a use case and is actually pretty awesome. Here's when to use it:

## Keeping branches up to date without merge commits

Merge commits can make your history [look a little janky](https://twitter.com/HenryHoffman/status/694184106440200192). A very simple rebase can keep pesky merge commits out of your PRs and history. The occasional merge commit isn't awful, but if a branch is worked on by multiple people over several months, the number of merge commits can become unruly.

Let's say you're working on a branch based off of master and want to pull in some changes. Usually that is done via `git pull origin master`. Instead, `git rebase origin/master` gets all of the changes and will replay your changes one-by-one at the end. High-five! Now you're up to date. :raised_hands:

Never fear overwriting anything. Merge conflicts can be resolved as part of the rebase process.

## Changing the source branch

It's really easy to start working on the wrong branch. Just as likely, you'll need to move commits from one branch to another. For a single commit `cherry-pick` is the way to go, but a weeks worth of work is better handled through rebasing. The [git book](http://git-scm.com/book/ch3-6.html#More-Interesting-Rebases) has a great example of rebasing on to other branches.

If you are interested in grabbing a particular range of commits, [there's a way to do that too](https://ariejan.net/2010/06/10/cherry-picking-specific-commits-from-another-branch/).

## Making better commits

You should be committing fairly early and often. You may even end up with nonsensical commit messages like: "Did a thing", "Made it work", and "Whoops".

That's fine! Rebasing allows you to [change these commit messages](https://coderwall.com/p/_thg9a/reword-a-git-commit-message) to something [actually useful](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). You can even [squash them into fewer](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html), more logical commits. :tada:

PRs with fewer commits are easier to review and help keep your history clean. That said, don't go squash happy and make every project a single commit.

## When not to use rebase

Rebasing is awesome but tread carefully. Avoid rebasing on branches that represent production (like release branches) or that others work on. Changing the history can cause serious grief if not communicated well.

You'll also almost never rebase the master branch (or whatever your source of truth is). Hopefully you aren't working too often on the master branch anyway.

As you're getting more comfortable with the tool, test your rebases out on separate branches. Worst case scenario, you can delete the branch.
