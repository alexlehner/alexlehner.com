As a designer, one of the best ways I have found to improve the professionalism of my design projects has been to present mockups of how the product will look on a real device. As the designers of Facebook Home said, [leave nothing to intepretation](http://vimeo.com/68749840 "Designing Facebook Home").

Fortunately there are no shortage of free device mock ups around the Internet. Below are some of my favorites. 

These are just at taste of all of the PSDs out there. Checkout [PremiumPixels.com](http://www.premiumpixels.com/), [Pixeden.com](http://www.pixeden.com/), and [GraphicBurger.com](http://graphicburger.com/) for many more.

*Note: Most of the PSDs below require Photoshop CS3 or higher and are able to be used for at least private use.*

Even though the Apple Watch has not been released to the public, many awesome mockups have already been released. I found my favorite on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/1719044-Apple-Watch-Free-Template-PSD) not too long ago. I've already started to put it to good use. I hope you'll do the same.
