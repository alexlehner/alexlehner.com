As a designer, one of the best ways I have found to improve the professionalism of my design projects has been to present mockups of how the product will look on a real device. As the designers of Facebook Home said, [leave nothing to intepretation](http://vimeo.com/68749840 "Designing Facebook Home").

Fortunately there are no shortage of free device mock ups around the Internet. Below are some of my favorites. 

These are just at taste of all of the PSDs there are out there. Checkout [PremiumPixels.com](http://www.premiumpixels.com/), [Pixeden.com](http://www.pixeden.com/), and [GraphicBurger.com](http://graphicburger.com/) for many more.

*Note: Most of the PSDs below require Photoshop CS3 or higher and are able to be used for at least private use.*

Awesome iPhone 5C mockup from the folks at Pixeden. It includes both portrait and landscape versions. I used this exact version in my article about [mobile navigation patterns](http://alexlehner.com/articles/mobile-nav-patterns/).

This freebie is an Apple 27in LED Cinema Display. It is a brilliant contribution from UI designer [Koy Carraway](https://twitter.com/#!/koycarraway). The fully layered PSD could make a sweet surround for showing off some work.
