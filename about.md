![Alex Lehner]({{site-url}}/images/alex-lehner-about.jpg)

Hi! I'm Alex. I use a mechanical keyboard and live in hex codes. If given the opportunity and resources, I would find a way to make a sport out of rollerblading and weather balloons.

In reality, I am a designer currently living in Tallahassee, FL. I have a passion for good design and development across all platforms. I love anything to do with mobile, UX, UI, gadgets, and IT. I also just finished my Masterâ€™s Degree at [Florida State University](http://fsu.edu/ "FSU Website...I didn't design it").

I like to spend my free time climbing and doing circus. Fun fact: I was a performer in the [FSU Flying High Circus](http://circus.fsu.edu/ "FSU Circus") for 4 years and did a mix of wire-walking, juggling, and trapeze. 

I'm currently looking for my next career adventure. Please find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexJLehner "Alex on Twitter") and [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/ajlehner "Alex on LinkedIn") or at [alex@lifelikegeek.com](mailto:alex@lifelikegeek.com).

Cheers,

Alex Lehner
