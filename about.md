I'm passionate about building products, good design, & mentoring others.

I'm working as a Staff Engineer on the [Mailchimp](https://twitter.com/mailchimp) engineering team where I get to build software for 15M people. I started my career and earned a couple of degrees from [Florida State](http://fsu.edu/ "FSU Website") before moving to Atlanta, GA.

In another life I performed in [a circus](http://circus.fsu.edu/ "FSU Flying High Circus Website") and did a mix of wire-walking, juggling, and trapeze.

Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexJLehner "Alex on Twitter"), [Linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/ajlehner "Alex on LinkedIn"), at [alex@alexlehner.com](mailto:alex@alexlehner.com), or [download my resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/AlexLehner-Resume2022.pdf) *(PDF 39KB)*.

Cheers,

Alex Lehner
