I like designing things. I've made websites, mobile apps, user experiences, brands, ads, databases, and probably more. 

I just finished my Master’s Degree at [Florida State University](http://fsu.edu/ "FSU Website") and I'm currently looking for my next career adventure. 

I like to spend my free time rock climbing and doing circus activities. I was a performer in the [FSU Flying High Circus](http://circus.fsu.edu/ "FSU Flying High Circus Website") for 4 years and did a mix of wire-walking, juggling, and trapeze.

For more info, find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexJLehner "Alex on Twitter"), [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/ajlehner "Alex on LinkedIn"), at [alex@lifelikegeek.com](mailto:alex@lifelikegeek.com), or [download my resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/AlexLehner-Resume2014.pdf) *(PDF 2.1MB)*. 

Cheers,

Alex Lehner
