I’m tough – I use a mechanical keyboard and dream in hex codes. I believe everyone should work in a restaurant once and they should continuously challenge status quo. If given the opportunity and resources, I would find a way to make a sport out of rollerblading and weather balloons.

In reality, I am a visual and front-end designer currently living in Tallahassee, FL. I have a passion for good development and expanding the usability, design, and creativity of websites and apps. I also just finished my Master’s Degree at [Florida State University](http://fsu.edu/ "FSU Website...I didn't design it").

Cheers,

Alex Lehner
