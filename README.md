## Getting started

The site is built using Jekyll so you'll want the [latest version of Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and make sure it's configured properly in your PATH. 

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/alexlehner/alexlehner.github.io.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd alexlehner.github.io
```

```bash
# Feel free to skip if you already have bundler. 
gem install --user-install bundler

# Grab all of the dependencies for running the site
bundle install
```

```bash
# Run Jekyll on watch mode and make your site available at http://127.0.0.1:4000
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
